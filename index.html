    <h1>My Family</h1>

    <p>I am writing this about my family. I have an older sister, and I live with both my mom and dad. I also have a dog named Macy. </p>

    <h2>Apparently I need a second heading so this is the second heading.</h2>

    <strong>This text is strong because it ate it's vegetables when it was young, you should too.</strong>
    <p></p>
    <p>And this text is in <em>itallics because they were born in Italy</em>.</p>
